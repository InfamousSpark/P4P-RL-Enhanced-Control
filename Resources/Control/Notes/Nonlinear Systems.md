Nonlinear systems exhibit several peculiar dynamic characteristics, which cannot be observed in linear systems. Some examples are
- Multiple isolated equilibrium points
	- Linear systems described by state equation x Ax Bu = + have only one equilibrium point at x = 0, u = 0.
- Limit cycles 
	- A fixed periodic response regardless of which initial conditions the system starts from.
- Finite escape time 
	- The response of one or more system states tends towards infinity within finite time interval.
- Subharmonic, harmonic or almost periodic oscillations
	- An input composed of a signal with single frequency may result in output which is a combination of multiple frequencies. The response may not have the same frequency components during different time intervals.
- Chaos 
	- The response may look very different, even though the system starts from almost similar initial conditions.
- Multiple modes of behavior
	- The system may behave in (finite but) different ways, based on its initial conditions.
