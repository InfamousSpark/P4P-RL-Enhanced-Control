Feedback controllers which influence the properties of plants described by [[State-Space Models]], by influencing the closed loop behaviour

With full-state feedback (FSFB) we assume all states are measured perfectly and available to generate control input $u(t)$ - perfect access

Control system is not the controller, control system is full block diagram, controller is just a portion
