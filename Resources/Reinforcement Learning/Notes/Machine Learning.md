Machine Learning is a branch of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving it's accuracy.

# Machine Learning Methods
Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.
## [[Supervised Learning]]
Supervised learning is defined by its use of labelled datasets to train algorithms to classify data, or predict outcomes. The model adjusts its weights bases on the data input into the model to fit the data appropriately.
This method is supervised due to the requirement that some of the data has to be labelled by a human so that the model can train.
## [[Unsupervised Learning]]
Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabelled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data grouping without the need for human intervention. 
This method's ability to discover similarities or differences in information make it ideal from data analysis, or image recognition.
## [[Reinforcement Learning]]
Reinforcement machine learning is a model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn't trained using sample data. Instead it learns as it goes using trail and error.

# Common Machine Learning Algorithms
A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:
- **[[Neural Networks]]:** Neural Networks  simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes. Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.
- **[[Linear regression]]:** This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a linear relationship between different values. For example, the technique could be used to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.
- **[[Logistic regression]]:** This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for categorical response variables, such as “yes/no” answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a production line.
- **[[Clustering]]:** Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.
- **[[Decision trees]]:** Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit, unlike the black box of the neural network.
- **[[Random forests]]:** In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.
