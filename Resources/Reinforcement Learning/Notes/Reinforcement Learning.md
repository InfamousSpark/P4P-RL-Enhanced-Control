Reinforcement Learning is a type of [[Machine Learning]] training method based on rewarding desired behaviour and punishing undesired ones. It is used for various software and machines to find the best possible behaviour or commonly path it should take in a given situation.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behaviour in an environment to obtain maximum reward. In RL, the data is accumulated from machine learning systems that use a trial-and-error method. Data is not part of the input that we would find in supervised or unsupervised machine learning.

Reinforcement learning uses algorithms that learn from outcomes and decide what action to take next. The algorithms make these decisions from the rewards and punishments it has received in previous iterations/actions. 

The strength of a RL algorithm is that it learns by trial and error with minimal human input.
# Types of Reinforcement
There are two types of reinforcement
## Positive
Positive Reinforcement reinforcement occurs when a desired behaviour occurs, increasing the strength and frequency of the behaviour. 
This maximises performance, but it can lead to an "overload" of states which can diminish the results, and prevent different strategies from being used.
## Negative
Negative Reinforcement is defined as the strengthening of a behaviour when a negative condition is stopped or did not occur.
